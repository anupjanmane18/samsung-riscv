<summary><b>Task 1:</b>Task is to install all the essential tools required for this samsung-RISCV  Workshop such as Ubuntu on VMBox & refer to C based and RISCV based lab videos and execute the task of compiling the C code using gcc and riscv compiler</summary><br>

  **Install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on Oracle Virtual Machine Box**
Firstly, I have downloaded the virtual box from the links provided to us and
loaded a linux version with image dock file sent

As the whole version of above code looks lengthier with different commands, we have obtained the required main 
part to compare the execution in assembly language:
