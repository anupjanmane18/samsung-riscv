<summary><b>Task 1:</b>Task is to install all the essential tools required for this samsung-RISCV  Workshop such as Ubuntu on VMBox & refer to C based and RISCV based lab videos and execute the task of compiling the C code using gcc and riscv compiler</summary><br>

### Install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on Oracle Virtual Machine Box

Firstly, I have downloaded the virtual box from the links provided to us and
loaded a linux version with image dock file sent  
![Ubuntu and VMBox Installation](https://github.com/anupjanmane18/samsung-riscv/blob/main/task1/virtual_machine_installed.png)

### C Language based LAB
I have successfully run the virtual machine and compiled the tasks.

Initial task is:-

### write a program to compile the sum of first 5 natural numbers in c:

we have written the code sum of 1st 5 numbers in leafpad as shown below.

```
gcc sum_1ton.c

./a.out
```

this code will be run in terminal to get output as 15 for 1st 5 numbers as shown below :

### RISCV based LAB

1. Using the cat command, the entire C code will be displayed on the terminal.

2. A program is run to obtain risc-v version of the code previously written in c:

  	 ```
	riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum_1ton.o sum_1ton.c
	```

3. As the whole version of above code looks lengthier we have used below code to make it shorter
	
 	```
	riscv64 -unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less
	```
 
& we have obtained the required main part to compare the execution in assembly language as shown below :

4. Open the same terminal and run the given command:
 
 	```
	riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum_1ton.o sum_1ton.c
	```

5. As the whole version of above code looks lengthier as earlier we have used below code to make it shorter
	
 	```
	riscv64 -unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less
	```
 
& we have obtained the required main part to compare the execution in assembly language as shown below :

<summary><b>Task 2:</b> Performing SPIKE Simulation and Debugging the C code with Interactive Debugging Mode using Spike
I understood the principle and working of the whole program and how various registers like stack pointer and r5 are increasing, understood how the interface explains the process itself.
</summary> 

### What is SPIKE in RISCV?
* Spike is a free, open-source C++ simulator for the RISC-V ISA that models a RISC-V core and cache system. It can be used to run programs and a Linux kernel, and can be a starting point for running software on a RISC-V target.

### Testing the SPIKE Simulator for sum1ton.c
**spike_O1_objdump**

* Here we are compare both of the compiler that must display the same output on the terminal.
* after that we are gona debug the sum1ton.c of **-O1_format** using SPIKE simulator

![image](https://github.com/anupjanmane18/samsung-riscv/blob/main/task2/spike_O1_objdump_for_sum1ton.png)

* In the above picture registor a0 earlier has value 21000 in hex decimal.
* After running the registor a0 became 21180 in hexa decimal.
* * Because there has +384 in decimal,so after calculation it gives the above value 

**Spike_Ofast_objdump**

* Here also goes the same we compare both of the compiler that must display the same output on the terminal.
* after that we are gona debug the sum1ton.c of **-Ofast_format** using SPIKE simulator



![image](https://github.com/anupjanmane18/samsung-riscv/blob/main/task2/spike_Ofast_objdump_for_sum1ton.png)

* In the above picture registor sp earlier has value 3ffffffb50 in hex decimal.
* After running the registor a0 became 3ffffffb40 in hexa decimal.
* Because there has -16 in decimal,so after calculation it gives the above value.

### Multiplication of first n natural numbers (C program):

**Here i have used n value as 7**

**riscv_objdump_O1_format**

* we have obtained the required main part to compare the execution in assembly language as shown below :

![image](https://github.com/anupjanmane18/samsung-riscv/blob/main/task2/Objdump_using%20-O1_format_for_mult.png)

**riscv_objdump_Ofast_format**

* we have obtained the required main part to compare the execution in assembly language as shown below :

![image](https://github.com/anupjanmane18/samsung-riscv/blob/main/task2/Objdump_using%20-Ofast_format_for_mult.png)


### Testing the SPIKE Simulator for new c program i.e mult1ton.c
**spike_O1_objdump**

* Here we are compare both of the compiler that must display the same output on the terminal.
* after that we are gona debug the sum1ton.c of **-O1_format** using SPIKE simulator

![image](https://github.com/anupjanmane18/samsung-riscv/blob/main/task2/spike_O1_objdump_for_mult1ton.png)

* In the above picture registor a2 earlier has value 1000 in hex decimal.
* After running the registor a2 became 13b0 in hexa decimal.
* Because there has +944 in decimal,so after calculation it gives the above value. 

**Spike_Ofast_objdump**

* Here also goes the same we compare both of the compiler that must display the same output on the terminal.
* after that we are gona debug the sum1ton.c of **-Ofast_format** using SPIKE simulator



![image](https://github.com/anupjanmane18/samsung-riscv/blob/main/task2/spike_Ofast_objdump_for_mult1ton.png)

* In the above picture registor a0 earlier has value 21000 in hex decimal.
* After running the registor a0 became 21180 in hexa decimal.
* Because there has +384 in decimal,so after calculation it gives the above value.

### Steps to debug spike simulation

* bring the pointer to a starting location using
```
until pc 0 100b0(loaction address uh wish to)
```
* next get the value of the registor by using
```
reg 0 a2(your registor address)
```
* next run the next intrsuction by clicking Enter key.
* after that repeat the above instruction i.e **reg 0** instruction & compare the previous value and next value.


* I have used same for both O1_format & Ofast_formate in sum1ton.c & mult1ton.c files
